Living session journal. Append a new dated entry at the end of every work session via `/wrap`. Newest at the bottom. This file is the project's working memory — any session should be resumable from here without relying on recall.

## (date) — Project bootstrapped

**Done this session**
- Repository and design docs in place (`README`, `PROJECT_BRIEF`, `CAPABILITIES`, `SAP_ALIGNMENT`, `ROADMAP`, `ENGINEERING`).
- Claude Code workflow configured: `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/settings.json`.
- ADR and spec scaffolding created; ADR-0001 recorded.

**Current eval numbers**
- None yet — eval harness arrives in Phase 1.

**Next**
- Phase 0: reproducible dev environment + a "hello world" of the conversational surface answering one hardcoded grounded question end-to-end. See `docs/ROADMAP.md`.

**Open questions / risks**
- Confirm SAP AI Core / HANA Cloud access path for later phases; not blocking local development.

**State of the tree**
- `main` green, no open branches.

## 2026-06-05 — Phase 0 complete (tooling skeleton + grounded hello-world)

**Done this session**
- Built the entire Phase 0 scaffolding as nine verified units, each via
  `/spec → /plan → implement → /verify → /commit`, on branches → PRs → CI-green →
  squash-merge once branch protection was enabled:
  1. uv-managed Python project — ruff, mypy (strict), pytest; Python pinned to
     3.12; `uv.lock` committed (`562cad4`, spec 0001).
  2. Pre-commit hooks — ruff, gitleaks, file hygiene (`02d10fb`, spec 0002).
  3. CI workflow — `gate` mirroring the local gate on every PR/push (`498a237`,
     spec 0003).
  4. Dockerfile + devcontainer — reproducible, non-root (`743d5c4`, PR #1, spec 0004).
  5. MkDocs Material site + Pages deploy — **live** at
     https://robert-vetter.github.io/tessera/ (`d247428`, PR #2, spec 0005).
  6. CHANGELOG — Keep a Changelog, seeded (`0d810e0`, PR #3, spec 0006).
  7. Issue/PR templates + Dependabot (github-actions/uv/docker) (`51b646d`,
     PR #4, spec 0007).
  8. README badges — CI, Docs, License (`fd5200e`, PR #7, spec 0008).
  9. Hello-world grounded-answer surface — `uv run tessera`, claim-level
     provenance + principled refusal, deterministic/LLM-free (`17f5574`, PR #8,
     spec 0009).
- Merged two Dependabot PRs bumping pinned actions to Node-24 versions
  (`checkout` v6.0.3 #5, `cache` v5.0.5 #6), clearing the Node-20 deprecation.
- Enabled (manual, by maintainer): branch protection requiring `gate` + PRs;
  GitHub Pages with the GitHub Actions source.

**Current eval numbers**
- None yet — the eval harness arrives in Phase 1. Unit 9 established the
  provenance contract the faithfulness metric will measure ("no claim without
  evidence"), enforced as a type invariant + tests.

**Next**
- **Phase 1 — the thin vertical slice** (Business Data Copilot). First unit of
  work: ingest **one** structured + **one** unstructured source through a single
  intake path into a common internal representation that preserves origin
  metadata (per `docs/ROADMAP.md` Phase 1 and `docs/CAPABILITIES.md` Pillar 1).
  The grounding core in `src/tessera/grounding.py` (EvidenceRecord/Claim/Answer)
  is the shape to grow real ingestion + retrieval into. The eval harness (small
  gold set + a first faithfulness number) is the other Phase 1 milestone.
- Start the next session with `/spec` for the ingestion unit.

**Open questions / risks**
- **Provenance data model** is the one durable design choice from Phase 0; if it
  proves load-bearing once real ingestion/retrieval land, record it with `/adr`
  in Phase 1 (flagged in spec 0009).
- Dependabot **security alerts** are disabled (separate from version updates,
  which work); enable in repo settings if CVE notifications are wanted.
- Confirm SAP AI Core / HANA Cloud access path for later phases; not blocking
  local development.

**State of the tree**
- `main` green and in sync with `origin/main`; no open branches. Tagged `phase-0`.
